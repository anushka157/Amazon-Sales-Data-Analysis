# Amazon Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing Amazon sales data to uncover key insights, trends, and patterns that can drive better decision-making. Using Python, various data analysis techniques are applied to process and visualize sales performance metrics.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, duplicate records, and data formatting.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying trends, correlations, and sales patterns.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Computing summary statistics and key performance indicators.
- **Visualization:** Creating insightful graphs and charts using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Predictive Insights:** Applying basic machine learning techniques for forecasting future sales trends.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset consists of Amazon sales records, including product details, prices, ratings, and customer reviews. The data was sourced from Kaggle.

## Installation & Setup
